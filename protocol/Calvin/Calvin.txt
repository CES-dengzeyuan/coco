Database is partitioned in Calvin. Transactions run deterministically following an order determined by Coordinator 0.
There are some partitions on each coordinator. For concurrency reasons, some partitions comprise a shard.
CalvinManager oversees a shard and grants read/write locks in a pre-determined order.
Once all lock (within the shard) are acquired, CalvinManager passes the transaction
to one of CalvinExecutor it manages.
CalvinExecutor runs the transaction to completion and releases all acquired locks.
